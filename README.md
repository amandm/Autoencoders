# Autoencoders

Experiments - 
Train a model to generate Gaussian with selected mean and variance
error analysis of that model on data with different mean and variance.

#Variations of Experiment

1. add more columns of data based on joint Guassian destribution
2. what if we change the probability distribution itself?
3. Change error function with respect to mutual information.
4. create model for GAN Autoencoder and variational autoencoder as well.
